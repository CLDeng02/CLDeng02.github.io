I'm a first-year postgraduate student majoring in Optical Engineering at Beijing University of Technology. My specialty is computational imaging. Here, you can find some introductory lecture notes on optics [Theoretical Optics](../assets/理论光学_CLDeng.pdf), as well as basic mathematical transformation formulas [Handbook of Integral Transforms](../assets/积分变换手册.pdf). The provided literature is for personal study only and must not be used for commercial dissemination.
